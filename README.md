# ReactiveObjCBridge

After the announcement of Swift, ReactiveCocoa was rewritten in Swift. This framework
creates a bridge between those Swift and Objective-C APIs (now known as [ReactiveSwift][]
and [ReactiveObjC][] respectively).

Because the APIs are based on fundamentally different designs, the conversion is
not always one-to-one; however, every attempt has been made to faithfully
translate the concepts between the two APIs (and languages).

The bridged types include:

 1. [`RACSignal` and `SignalProducer` or `Signal`](#racsignal-and-signalproducer-or-signal)
 1. [`RACCommand` and `Action`](#raccommand-and-action)
 1. [`RACScheduler` and `SchedulerType`](#racscheduler-and-schedulertype)
 1. [`RACDisposable` and `Disposable`](#racdisposable-and-disposable)

For the complete bridging API, including documentation, see [`ObjectiveCBridging.swift`][ObjectiveCBridging].

## `RACSignal` and `SignalProducer` or `Signal`

In ReactiveSwift, “cold” signals are represented by the `SignalProducer` type,
and “hot” signals are represented by the `Signal` type.

“Cold” `RACSignal`s can be converted into `SignalProducer`s using the
`SignalProducer` initializer:

```swift
extension SignalProducer where Error == Swift.Error {
	public init<SignalValue>(_ signal: RACSignal<SignalValue>) where Value == SignalValue?
}
```

“Hot” `RACSignal`s cannot be directly converted into `Signal`s, because _any_
`RACSignal` subscription could potentially involve side effects. To obtain a
`Signal`, use `RACSignal.toSignalProducer` followed by `SignalProducer.start`,
which will make those potential side effects explicit.

For the other direction, use the `bridged` property.

When invoked on a `SignalProducer`, these functions will create a `RACSignal` to
 `start()` the producer once for each subscription:

```swift
extension SignalProducerProtocol where Value: AnyObject {
	public var bridged: RACSignal<Value>
}

extension SignalProducerProtocol where Value: OptionalProtocol, Value.Wrapped: AnyObject {
	public var bridged: RACSignal<Value.Wrapped>
}

```

When invoked on a `Signal`, these methods will create a `RACSignal` that simply
observes it:

```swift
extension SignalProtocol where Value: AnyObject {
    public var bridged: RACSignal<Value.Wrapped> {
}

extension SignalProtocol where Value: OptionalProtocol, Value.Wrapped: AnyObject {
    public var bridged: RACSignal<Value.Wrapped> {
}
```

`RACSignal`s of numbered tuples can be bridged to `SignalProducer`s of Swift
tuples with a special initializer, `init(bridging:)`:

```swift
extension SignalProducer where Error == Swift.Error {
	public init<First>(bridging tupleSignal: RACSignal<RACOneTuple<First>>) where Value == First?
  public init<First, Second>(bridging tupleSignal: RACSignal<RACTwoTuple<First, Second>>) where Value == (First?, Second?)?
  public init<First, Second, Third>(bridging tupleSignal: RACSignal<RACThreeTuple<First, Second, Third>>) where Value == (First?, Second?, Third?)?
  public init<First, Second, Third, Fourth>(bridging tupleSignal: RACSignal<RACFourTuple<First, Second, Third, Fourth>>) where Value == (First?, Second?, Third?, Fourth?)?
  public init<First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth>(bridging tupleSignal: RACSignal<RACFiveTuple<First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth>>) where Value == (First?, Second?, Third?, Fourth?, Fifth?)?
}
```

## `RACCommand` and `Action`

To convert `RACCommand`s into the new `Action` type, use the `Action` initializer:

```swift
extension Action where Error == Swift.Error {
	public convenience init<CommandInput, CommandOutput>(
		_ command: RACCommand<CommandInput, CommandOutput>
	) where Input == CommandInput?, Output == CommandOutput?
}
```

To convert `Action`s into `RACCommand`s, use the `bridged` instance
method:

```swift
extension Action where Input: AnyObject, Output: AnyObject {
	public var bridged: RACCommand<Input, Output>
}

extension Action where Input: OptionalProtocol, Input.Wrapped: AnyObject, Output: AnyObject {
	public var bridged: RACCommand<Input.Wrapped, Output>
}

extension Action where Input: AnyObject, Output: OptionalProtocol, Output.Wrapped: AnyObject {
	public var bridged: RACCommand<Input, Output.Wrapped>
}

extension Action where Input: OptionalProtocol, Input.Wrapped: AnyObject, Output: OptionalProtocol, Output.Wrapped: AnyObject {
	public var bridged: RACCommand<Input.Wrapped, Output.Wrapped>
}
```

**NOTE:** The `executing` properties of actions and commands are not
synchronized across the API bridge. To ensure consistency, only observe the
`executing` property from the base object (the one passed _into_ the bridge, not
retrieved from it), so updates occur no matter which object is used for
execution.

## `RACScheduler` and `SchedulerType`

Any `RACScheduler` instance is automatically a `DateSchedulerType` (and
therefore a `SchedulerType`), and can be passed directly into any function or
method that expects one.

All `Scheduler`s and `DateScheduler`s can be wrapped as a `RACScheduler` using the `RACScheduler` initializer:

```swift
extension RACScheduler {
	public convenience init(_ scheduler: Scheduler)
	public convenience init(_ scheduler: DateScheduler)
}
```

Note that wrapped `Scheduler`s would behave like `RACImmediateScheduler` when deferred
scheduling methods are used.

## `RACDisposable` and `Disposable`

Any `RACDisposable` instance is automatically a `Disposable`, and can be used
 directly anywhere a type conforming to `Disposable` is expected.

Use the `RACDisposable` initializer to wrap an instance of `Disposable`:

```swift
extension RACDisposable {
	public convenience init(_ disposable: Disposable?)
}
```

## Numbered `RACTuple`s

Numbered (and typed) `RACTuple` subtypes, such as `RACOneTuple`, `RACTwoTuple`
etc., can be bridged to native Swift tuples with a series of global functions:

```swift
public func bridgedTuple<First>(from tuple: RACOneTuple<First>) -> (First?)
public func bridgedTuple<First, Second>(from tuple: RACTwoTuple<First, Second>) -> (First?, Second?)
public func bridgedTuple<First, Second, Third>(from tuple: RACThreeTuple<First, Second, Third>) -> (First?, Second?, Third?)
public func bridgedTuple<First, Second, Third, Fourth>(from tuple: RACFourTuple<First, Second, Third, Fourth>) -> (First?, Second?, Third?, Fourth?)
public func bridgedTuple<First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth>(from tuple: RACFiveTuple<First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth>) -> (First?, Second?, Third?, Fourth?, Fifth?)
```
