                   After announced Swift, ReactiveCocoa was rewritten in Swift. This framework creates a bridge between those Swift and Objective-C APIs (ReactiveSwift and ReactiveObjC).

                   Because the APIs are based on fundamentally different designs, the conversion is not always one-to-one; however, every attempt has been made to faithfully translate the concepts between the two APIs (and languages).
